## Optional Tasks (Not Implemented)

The following tasks are marked as optional (with `*` suffix) and are not required for core functionality:

### Property-Based Tests
- Trait generation bounds
- Rarity tier correctness
- Metadata URI uniqueness
- Initial state correctness
- Cooldown enforcement
- Activity timestamp update
- Reward accumulation
- Token transfer correctness
- And 40+ more property tests

### Unit Tests
- Beast minting tests
- Activity system tests
- Reward claiming tests
- Trait upgrade tests
- Breeding tests
- Treasury operation tests
- Security validation tests
- UI component tests
- API endpoint tests
- Integration tests

**Note**: While these tests are valuable, they were marked as optional to focus on core feature delivery. They can be implemented in future iterations for enhanced quality assurance.

2. Conduct security audit (for mainnet)
3. Set up monitoring infrastructure
4. Test all user flows end-to-end
5. Gather community feedback

### Short-Term (Post-Launch)
1. Implement property-based tests
2. Add comprehensive unit test coverage
3. Integrate Arweave/IPFS for metadata
4. Implement multiple activity types
5. Deploy monitoring and analytics

### Long-Term (Future Iterations)
1. DAO governance implementation
2. Advanced breeding mechanics
3. Beast abilities and combat system
4. Marketplace integration
5. Mobile native apps
